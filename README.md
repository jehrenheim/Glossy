A CSS-Based Text Effect

Glossy adds eye catching effects to any text with simple fallbacks for unsupported browsers.

Simply add the "glossy" class to any text and the fixed glossy background is applied, creating the illusion of glossy text on a matte finish. The script also includes classes for holographic ("holographic" class) and gold foil ("gold" class) styles.
